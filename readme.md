### Project Summary
Your personal portfolio consists of two main HTML files: `index.html` and `resume.html`. 

- **index.html**:
  - This serves as the homepage of your portfolio.
  - It includes navigation links to different sections: Home, Resume, About, and Contact.
  - The page features a brief introduction, your educational background, an about section detailing your journey into computer science, and contact information with links to your social media profiles.

- **resume.html**:
  - This page provides a detailed view of your resume.
  - It includes your contact information, educational history, and volunteer experience.

### Running the Portfolio
To run your portfolio locally, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Files**:
   - Ensure you have `index.html` and `resume.html` in the same directory.

2. **Open in a Browser**:
   - Simply double-click on `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
   - You can navigate to the resume by clicking the "View Full Resume" button.

3. **Local Server (Optional)**:
   - For a more robust experience (especially if you have additional functionality planned), consider running a local server:
     - If you have Python installed, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:
       ```bash
       python -m http.server
       ```
     - Then open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` to view your portfolio.

### Notes
- Ensure all images and external resources (like social media icons) are correctly linked and accessible in your project folder.
- You might want to improve styling and layout using CSS for a more polished look.
